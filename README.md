# Survival-and-Death-Model
Stochastic effect in survival and apoptosis pathway by TNF-α, modeling

Abstract:
The cells walk in a noisy environment and manage the outside stimulation to make the decision. The survival process and the death pathway are opposing signals, but it could be simultaneously activated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) within a single cell via the same ligand-receptor complex. The survival process is major in the regulation of Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) networks. Apoptosis, programmed cell death save other cells from infection or stimulated damage, radiation etc. However, How the TNF regulate the trend of survival or death is unclear. To interpret the stochastic effect of survival and apoptosis by TNF-α, we use chemical Langevin equations and statistics methods to get the mean pattern of systems.
